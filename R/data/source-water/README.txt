README for the observed and simulated data for the "sw" (source water) dataset
author: William Raseman

Raw Data: the raw source water quality data from Fort Collins can be found in "raw-data_poudre-river_fort-collins.zip"

./01_import_clean
	
	The raw data was manually consolidated into two datasets contained in ./01_import_clean: sw_plant-intake_pH-temp.xlsx 
	and sw_plant-intake_toc-alk.xlsx 

	sw_plant-intake_*.xlsx: these files contain source water quality information for two sampling locations--
	the intake on the Cache la Poudre River and at the head of the treatment plant. 
		
	These files are read in by ../../01_import_clean.R
	
./02_create_ts 
	
	After the data is cleaned and aggregated to a monthly timestep within ../../01_import_clean.R, it is saved 
	as ./02_create_ts/sw_cleaned-agg-monthly.rds
	
	Since there are missing data points, time series interpolation is used to create a complete dataset, and 
	is saved as ./02_create_ts/sw_ts.rds
	
./04_simulate_kNN	
	
	Simulated data generated by ../../04_simulate_kNN.R are contained within ./04_simulate_kNN. After running
	all scripts, this will include:
		
	kNN_innov-*_sw_*.rds
		These files are dataframes of simulated data for various kNN runs. The "innov" aspect of the 
		file name refers to whether or not random innovations were included in the algorithm. 
		A distinct dataframe (and .rds file) is created for each simulated variable.
